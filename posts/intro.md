# Introduction

Welcome to my blog! This is a test post to demonstrate markdown rendering with LaTeX support.

## Features

- **Markdown** formatting
- Code blocks
- Math equations

## Example Math

Here's an inline equation: $E = mc^2$

And here's a block equation:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

## Code Example

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log('Hello, world!')
}
```

That's it for now!
