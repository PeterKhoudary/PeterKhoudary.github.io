Welcome to my blog! This is a test post to demonstrate markdown rendering with LaTeX support. This took way longer than I would ever admit.

# Features

- **Markdown** formatting
- Code blocks
- Math equations

# Example Math

Here's an inline equation: $69 \leq 420$

And here's a block equation:

$$
\begin{align*}
  \sum_{v \in V} deg(v) &= 2|E| \\
  &\leq n(n - 1)
\end{align*}
$$

# Code Example

```python
def hello():
  print('Im like hey whats up hello')
```

That's it for now!
